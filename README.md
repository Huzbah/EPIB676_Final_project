# EPIB676_Final_project
Final Project for EPIB 676: Analytical Decision Modelling 

A Discrete Event Simulation Model to demostrate Donor Return Dynamics using predictors from penalised cox proportional hazard model to simulate donorâ€™s time to return under different alternatives, and then predict the probabiity of a hemoglobin deferral.
